Removes Bloatware from HP Devices

If you don’t maintain a prebuilt Windows image used to deploy new workstation because you simply build them as they come in then this tool may be for you.

We prefer HP equipment but they always come with annoying HP bloatware. You could reload the device but that takes time you don’t want to waste.

One of my fellow engineers Thomas Lambert put this little script together which will run through and uninstall the most common pre-installed HP software.

Un-box the PC or Laptop, run through the basic setup steps then run the script ‘As Administrator’ and it saves time and ensures all those annoying installs get removed correctly every time!
